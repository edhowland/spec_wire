# roadmap
combine start and stop scripts into single file with options:

--start 
--stop
--status
--server={servername with path}
--pidfile={pidfile with path}

Use startup scripts in /etc/init.d/ as a model
Should we enable the scripts to handle more than one service?
Need to handle case if startup doesn't succeed.
